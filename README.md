# Ireland-Maze
<h2>Summary:</h2>
A maze to collect all the Guinnesses in Ireland. The game was created for my CSC 383 college Python course and was built entirely 
in Python and the PyGame API.
<br />

<h2>To Execute:</h2>
1. Install Python and PyGame for your OS. Check that the software versions are compatible.<br />
2. In Python (for Windows/Mac/Linux) run ArmstrongFinalOriginal.py or ArmstrongFinalVersionAlternateVersion.py (the alternate version 
will allow for the player to bounce off the walls).<br />
3. Use the arrow keys to navigate the maze. In order to win, the player must collect the Guiness glasses and reach the exit (the maze 
opening on the bottom of the window) before the timer runs out.
